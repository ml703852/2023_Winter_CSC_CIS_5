   Thank you for playing my Casino Game, and being an awesome Professor. 
	I really enjoyed taking your class, and hope to take more 
		of your courses in the future.

	I apologize if this was not the correct way to utilize the <fstream> libary, but I struggled 
	a bit with it and thought to write a message instead.

Your Student,
